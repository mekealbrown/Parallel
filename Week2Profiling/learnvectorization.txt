Let's break this down into extremely detailed sections:

1. AVX2 FUNDAMENTALS
-------------------
AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) is a SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instruction set that allows processing multiple data elements simultaneously.

Key Concepts:
a) Vector Register (__m256d):
   - 256 bits wide
   - Can hold 4 double-precision floating-point numbers
   - Represented in code as __m256d type
   
b) Vector Operations:
   - Operate on all elements simultaneously
   - Example: One multiplication instruction processes 4 pairs of numbers

2. MEMORY ALIGNMENT
------------------
```c
double* b_col = (double*)aligned_alloc(32, n * sizeof(double));
```

Why 32-byte alignment?
- AVX2 performs best with 32-byte aligned memory
- 32 bytes = 256 bits (size of vector register)
- Improper alignment can cause:
  * Performance penalties
  * Potential crashes on some architectures

3. VECTORIZED OPERATIONS DETAILED
-------------------------------
A. Vector Initialization:
```c
__m256d sum_vector = _mm256_setzero_pd();
```
- Creates a vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
- Used as accumulator for sums
- More efficient than loading zeros from memory

B. Loading Data:

```c
__m256d a_vector = _mm256_loadu_pd(&A[i][k]);
```

- _mm256_loadu_pd: Loads 4 consecutive doubles into vector register
- 'u' in loadu means "unaligned" - can handle unaligned memory
- Less efficient than aligned loads but more flexible

C. Fused Multiply-Add (FMA):
```c
sum_vector = _mm256_fmadd_pd(a_vector, b_vector, sum_vector);
```
This single instruction does:
```c
// Conceptually equivalent to:
sum_vector[0] += a_vector[0] * b_vector[0];
sum_vector[1] += a_vector[1] * b_vector[1];
sum_vector[2] += a_vector[2] * b_vector[2];
sum_vector[3] += a_vector[3] * b_vector[3];
```
All in one CPU cycle!

4. MEMORY ACCESS PATTERNS
------------------------
A. Column Extraction:
```c
for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    b_col[k] = B[k][j];
}
```
Why needed?
- Matrix B accessed by columns
- Memory in C is row-major
- Column access causes cache misses
- Copying to contiguous array improves performance

B. Memory Access Visualization:
Original access pattern:
```
B[0][j]  →  Cache miss
B[1][j]  →  Cache miss
B[2][j]  →  Cache miss
B[3][j]  →  Cache miss
```

After column extraction:
```
b_col[0]  →  Cache hit
b_col[1]  →  Cache hit
b_col[2]  →  Cache hit
b_col[3]  →  Cache hit
```

5. HANDLING NON-VECTOR-SIZE MATRICES
----------------------------------
```c
int vec_limit = n - (n % 4);
```

Example for n = 10:
- vec_limit = 10 - (10 % 4) = 8
- First 8 elements processed with vectors
- Last 2 elements processed scalar

Processing breakdown:
1. Vector portion (k = 0 to 7):
   - Processes elements in groups of 4
   - Two vector iterations: 0-3 and 4-7

2. Scalar portion (k = 8 to 9):
   - Processes remaining elements one by one
   - Uses standard multiplication and addition

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------
A. Theoretical Speedup:
- 4 multiplications and 4 additions per cycle
- Potential 4x speedup for arithmetic
- Reality: Memory bandwidth often limits performance

B. Memory Hierarchy Impact:
- L1 cache: ~4 cycles access time
- L2 cache: ~10 cycles
- L3 cache: ~40-50 cycles
- Main memory: ~200-300 cycles

C. Performance Limiters:
1. Memory bandwidth
2. Cache misses
3. Memory alignment
4. Matrix size

7. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
---------------------------
1. Cache Blocking:
   - Process matrix in smaller blocks
   - Keep blocks in L1/L2 cache

2. Loop Unrolling:
   - Process multiple rows/columns at once
   - Reduce loop overhead

3. Prefetching:
   - Load data before it's needed
   - Hide memory latency

4. Multi-threading:
   - Parallelize across multiple cores
   - Combine with vectorization

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide more specific examples of any part?





1. How Matrix Multiplication Works:
- For each element C[i][j], we need:
  * One row from A (A[i][*])
  * One column from B (B[*][j])

2. Memory Layout in C:
```
Matrix A (stored row by row):
[a00 a01 a02]  <- Contiguous in memory
[a10 a11 a12]  <- Contiguous in memory
[a30 a31 a32]  <- Contiguous in memory

Matrix B (also stored row by row):
[b00 b01 b02]  <- Contiguous in memory
[b10 b11 b12]  <- Contiguous in memory
[b20 b21 b22]  <- Contiguous in memory
```

3. Memory Access Patterns:

For Matrix A:
```c
// Accessing A[i][0], A[i][1], A[i][2]...
// This is GOOD - accessing contiguous memory (one row)
A[i][0], A[i][1], A[i][2]  // These are next to each other in memory
```

For Matrix B without column extraction:
```c
// Accessing B[0][j], B[1][j], B[2][j]...
// This is BAD - jumping through memory (one column)
B[0][j]  // Jump n elements to get to
B[1][j]  // Jump n elements to get to
B[2][j]  // Jump n elements to get to
```

4. Why This Matters:
- CPU caches work best with contiguous memory access
- When accessing B's columns:
  * Each element is n elements away from the next one
  * Each access might cause a cache miss
  * Very inefficient for the CPU cache

5. The Solution (Column Extraction):
```c
// Copy column to contiguous array
for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    b_col[k] = B[k][j];
}
```

Now when we process the column:
- All elements are contiguous in memory
- CPU can efficiently prefetch data
- Better cache utilization
- Vector operations can load 4 elements at once efficiently

6. Visual Example:
```
Without Column Extraction:
B matrix in memory:
[b00 b01 b02 b03]  // Need b00
[b10 b11 b12 b13]  // Need b10
[b20 b21 b22 b23]  // Need b20
[b30 b31 b32 b33]  // Need b30

Access pattern: ↓ (jumping between rows)

After Column Extraction:
b_col array:
[b00 b10 b20 b30]  // All elements we need are contiguous

Access pattern: → (smooth linear access)
```

We don't need to extract rows from A because:
1. A's rows are already contiguous in memory
2. Vector operations can already efficiently load from A's rows
3. CPU cache already handles this access pattern well

This is why we only extract columns from B - it transforms a cache-unfriendly access pattern into a cache-friendly one, which is especially important for vectorized operations that load multiple elements at once.
